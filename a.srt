Hi. Welcome to Version Control.

0:00:02.050,0:00:04.300
I'm Carolyn, one of your instructors for the course.

0:00:04.300,0:00:05.350
>> And I'm Sarah, your other instructor.

0:00:05.350,0:00:08.340
In this course, we'll cover the concept of Version Control and

0:00:08.340,0:00:09.960
why you might want to use it.

0:00:09.960,0:00:12.610
>> Yeah. So, Version Control is sort of like having a giant undo button for

0:00:12.610,0:00:13.530
your project.

0:00:13.530,0:00:15.720
>> You mean like this one?

0:00:15.720,0:00:16.600
>> Yeah, exactly.

0:00:16.600,0:00:19.320
It makes it easy to save versions of your files at different points in time.

0:00:19.320,0:00:22.190
You can also restore previous versions and compare different version.

0:00:22.190,0:00:25.386
Yeah, it also makes it a lot easier to collaborate with other people.

0:00:25.386,0:00:28.598
>> No more sending huge .zip files of your project back and forth.

0:00:28.598,0:00:32.211
>> Now, learning to use Version Control is a little bit like learning to type:

0:00:32.211,0:00:35.948
it's hard at first, but once you can do it, it makes you a lot more efficient.

0:00:35.948,0:00:39.081
>> You might feel like learning a whole new system to keep track of versions of

0:00:39.081,0:00:41.252
your files is a lot of work and maybe not worth it, or

0:00:41.252,0:00:44.200
that if you're hard core enough, you don't need Version Control.

0:00:44.200,0:00:46.930
But if you look at successful companies like Google and

0:00:46.930,0:00:49.260
Facebook, you'll find that they all use Version Control internally.

0:00:49.260,0:00:51.000
What about you, Caroline?

0:00:51.000,0:00:53.480
>> Well, when I first started using Version Control,

0:00:53.480,0:00:55.300
I basically only used it when I needed to.

0:00:55.300,0:00:57.450
But now I like to use it for all of my projects.

0:00:57.450,0:00:58.600
It's kind of addicting.

0:00:58.600,0:00:59.280
>> Cool.

0:00:59.280,0:00:59.960
Let's find out why.
